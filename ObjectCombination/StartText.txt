Hello Player.
Welcome to a simple survival game.
The idea is to build several objects with the items given to you.
Every succesful build grants you a point.
But if you remake an object it will no count as a point.

The recipes are very simple.
Get a stick and a rock you make a spear.
Get a stick and a coal you make a torch.
Get a mushroom and a bowl you make mushroom soup.

On the table you have available 5 sticks, 2 coals, 3 rocks, 4 bowls and 2 mushroom.

What will you do?
